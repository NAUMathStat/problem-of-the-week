<p>A very tiny Alice is racing across a 2-by-2 chessboard, where each smaller square has a side length of 1 cm. Alice starts at the bottom-left corner of the bottom-left black square and is trying to reach the top-right corner of the top-right black square. </p>

<p>
There’s just one catch. Alice moves faster on the white squares than she does on the black squares. Her speed on the white squares is 1 cm per minute (again, she’s very small), while her speed on the black squares is 0.9 cm per minute.</p>

<p>What’s the least amount of time it will take her to reach the finish?
 </p>
