<b>Rules for Problem of the Week</b>
<p>
The contest is open to all undergraduates at Northern Arizona University.
<p>
Send your submissions or questions to Jim Swift at
<a href="mailto:jwswift@gmail.com?subject=potw" target="_blank">jwswift@gmail.com</a> by the due date and time.
Please include the subject &ldquo;potw&rdquo;.
You may attach a pdf to the email.  Please do not send jpegs, pngs, MS Word documents, etc.
There are many free aps to make a pdf with your phone camera. I like Adobe scan.
To answer some problems, you don't need a scan.
You can use the &ldquo;TeX for Gmail&rdquo; extension to get nice equations within email.
<p>The answers should be clearly and logically explained.  The goal is to write mathematics, not to
 to write down the answer and draw a box around it.
<p>
	If your instructor gives you credit for submissions to problem of the week, please include their name
	and the class  (e.g. Swift, MAT 239).
</p><p>
	Problems will be graded on a scale of 1 to 3.  A model solution is posted each week.
	A ladder listing the points earned is posted in the lobby of the Adel Math Building 
	(across from the MAP room).  Your name will be printed on the ladder, but no names will be published on the web.
	Let me know if you want to remain anonymous on the posted ladder.
