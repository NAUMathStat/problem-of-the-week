<p> Two players are playing the following game on an $8\times 8$ chessboard: taking turns, each player selects one edge that borders two squares on the chessboard and coloring it blue. (Note: this means edges on the boundary of the chessboard are not in play.) The player who is forced to create a closed blue polygon loses the game. Which player has a winning strategy and what is it?  </p>
