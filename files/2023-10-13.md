<p> A regular hexagon is divided into a triangular grid, and completely tiled with diamonds (two triangles glued together). Diamonds can be placed in one of three orientations. Prove that, no matter how the board is tiled, there will be the same number of diamonds in each orientation. (Prove this for any tiling and for a hexagon with any number of triangles on each side.) </p>
