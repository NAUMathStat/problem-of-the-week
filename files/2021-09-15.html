<p>
The graph of the function \(f\) is shown.

<img src = "files/2021-09-15.png" style="width:300px;height:198">
</center>
As suggested by the graph, \(f\) is even and the global minimum value of \(f\) is \(-2\).
<p>
How many solutions to \(f(f(x)) = -2\) are there?
</p><p>
Hint: You do not need to find a formula for \(f\), 
or the exact value(s) of \(x\) that solve the equation.

<b>Rules for Problem of the Week</b>
<p>
The contest is open to all undergraduates at Northern Arizona University.
<p>
Send your submissions or questions to Jim Swift at
<a href="mailto:jwswift@gmail.com?subject=potw" target="_blank">jwswift@gmail.com</a> by the due date and time.
Please include the subject &ldquo;potw&rdquo;.
You may attach a pdf (possily a scan) to the plain text email.  No MS Word documents, please.
You can use the &ldquo;TeX for Gmail&rdquo; extension to get nice equations within email.
<p>The answers should be clearly and logically explained.  The goal is to write mathematics, not to
 to write down the answer and draw a box around it.
</p>
<p>
	If your instructor gives you credit for sumbmissions to problem of the week, please include their name
	and the class  (e.g. Swift, MAT 239).
