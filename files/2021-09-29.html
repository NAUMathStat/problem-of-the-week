A fictitious species of tree grows in an unusual way.  In the first year, 
the tree grows a trunk which is a square of side length 4 feet.
In the second year, a right isoceles triangle grows, attached to the top of the trunk, and two more squares
grow at the legs of right triangle.  In the third year, a right isocoles thiangle and two squares grow at each leading
edge.  The figure shows the tree after three years, with the colors showing the growth every year.

The process continues for a forth year.  How tall and how wide is the tree after 4 years?

Hint: Use graph paper to sketch the tree.

<b>Rules for Problem of the Week</b>
<p>
The contest is open to all undergraduates at Northern Arizona University.
<p>
Send your submissions or questions to Jim Swift at
<a href="mailto:jwswift@gmail.com?subject=potw" target="_blank">jwswift@gmail.com</a> by the due date and time.
Please include the subject &ldquo;potw&rdquo;.
You may attach a pdf (possily a scan) to the plain text email.  No MS Word documents, please.
You can use the &ldquo;TeX for Gmail&rdquo; extension to get nice equations within email.
<p>The answers should be clearly and logically explained.  The goal is to write mathematics, not to
 to write down the answer and draw a box around it.
</p>
<p>
	If your instructor gives you credit for sumbmissions to problem of the week, please include their name
	and the class  (e.g. Swift, MAT 239).
</p><p>
	Problems will be graded on a scale of 1 to 3.  A model solution will be posted each week.
	A ladder listing the points earned will be posted in the lobby of the Adel Math Building 
	(across from the MAP room).  Your name will be printed on the ladder, but no names will be published on the web.
	Let me know if you want to remain anonymous on the posted ladder.
