The graph of the function \(f\) is shown.

<!--  this following line did not work.  I did something tricky for the first week, but I editied it because it
did not work in the archives.

</center>
As suggested by the graph, \(f\) is even and the global minimum value of \(f\) is \(-2\).
</p><p>
How many solutions to \(f(f(x)) = -2\) are there?
</p><p>
Hint: You do not need to find a formula for \(f\), 
or the exact value(s) of \(x\) that solve the equation.

<b>Rules for Problem of the Week</b>
<p>
The contest is open to all undergraduates at Northern Arizona University.
<p>
Send your submissions or questions to Jim Swift at
<a href="mailto:jwswift@gmail.com?subject=potw" target="_blank">jwswift@gmail.com</a> by the due date and time.
Please include the subject &ldquo;potw&rdquo;.
You may attach a pdf (possily a scan) to the plain text email.  No MS Word documents, please.
You can use the &ldquo;TeX for Gmail&rdquo; extension to get nice equations within email.
<p>The answers should be clearly and logically explained.  The goal is to write mathematics, not to
 to write down the answer and draw a box around it.
</p>
<p>
	If your instructor gives you credit for sumbmissions to problem of the week, please include their name
	and the class  (e.g. Swift, MAT 239).
</p><p>
	Problems will be graded on a scale of 1 to 3.  A model solution will be posted each week.
	A ladder listing the points earned will be posted in the lobby of the Adel Math Building 
	(across from the MAP room).  Your name will be printed on the ladder, but no names will be published on the web.
	Let me know if you want to remain anonymous on the posted ladder.
