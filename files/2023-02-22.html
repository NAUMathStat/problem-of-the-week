title: Problem of the Week

-->

<p> Four ships left a port at noon on January 2, 1953. The first ship returns to this port every 4 weeks. The second ship returns every 8 weeks, the third every 12 weeks and the fourth every 14. When did all four ships meet again for the first time?  </p>

<p> Reminder: I am looking for a well-reasoned solution that walks me through the mathematical reasoning, not just an answer with a box around it. </p>
