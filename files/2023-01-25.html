<p> Label the vertices of a triangle 1, 2, and 3. Arrange 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 along the sides of the triangle so that the numbers along each side sum to 17.  </p>

<p> Now try a harder variation. Without being told which numbers to place at the vertices, make a similar arrangement of the numbers from 1 through 9, adding to 20 along each side. Bonus: Is your solution unique? </p>
