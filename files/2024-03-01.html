<p>	Nikoli the snake wants to slither along a loop through a four-by-four grid of points. To form a loop, Nikoli can connect any horizontally or vertically adjacent points with a line segment. However, Nikoli has certain standards when it comes to loop construction. In particular: </p>
<ul> 
	<li> The loop can never cross over itself.</li>
	<li> No two corners of the loop can meet at the same point.</li>
	<li> Once Nikoli has crossed the connection between two points, Nikoli canâ€™t cross it again (in either direction).</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the following are two constructions of valid loops.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the following three constructions are not valid. The one on the left crosses over itself, the one in the middle has two corners that meet at a single point, and the one on the right requires Nikoli to pass over the same line segment twice.

<p> How many unique loops can Nikoli make on the four-by-four grid? (For any given loop, Nikoli can travel in two directions around it. However, these should still be counted as a single loop.) </p>
