<p> You are walking on a road through an enchanted forest ruled by gnomes.You come to a fork in the road. One path leads to death, the other to certain saftey (you've read about such forks in the road). At the intersection, you encounter three gnomes. You know one cannot lie, one cannot tell the truth, and one will speak truthfully or lie as they see fit â€”but you do not know who is who (as these things always go). </p>

<p> You may ask two questions. Each question must be addressed to only one gnome, and only they will respond.</p>


<p> How do you determine the safe path? </p>

<p> Hint: This problem is pushing the limit of how much information you can get from the gnomes with only two questions. A good way to start might be to solve the same problem, except you get four questions. Then try it with three.
 </p>

 <!-- Note: This is the classic knight, knave and spie problem rewritten to be harder to google -->
