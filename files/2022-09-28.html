<p>Arrange five coins in a row, alternating whether each coin is showing heads or tails as shown below. The problem is to change their positions to the arrangement shown in the bottom row in the shortest possible number of moves. </p>

<p>A move consists of placing the tips of the first and second fingers on any two coins, one of which must have heads facing up and the other with tails facing up, then sliding the pair to another spot along the imaginary line shown in the illustration. the two coins in the pair must touch at all times. The coin at the left in the pair must remain at the left; the coin at the right must remain at the right. Gaps in the chain are allowed at the end of any move except the final one. After the last move, the coins need not be at the same spot on the imaginary line that they occupied at the start. </p>

<p>If it were possible to shift two coins that both have heads or tails facing up, the puzzle could be solved easily in three moves. </p>
