<p> Flip a fair coin 100 times. It gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point. For each HT, Bob gets a point. For example, for the sequence THHHT, Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. Who is most likely to win? That is, who is more likely to have more points after the 100 flips? </p>

<p>(Hint: this may not be as simple as it first appears.)</p>
