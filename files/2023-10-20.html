<p> This week's POTW is inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/2835/">a recent XKCD.</a></p>

<p> Number systems like decimal, binary, and hexadecimal each have a fixed number of allowed digits in each place (10, 2, and 16, respectively), while “mixed-radix” systems like the 24-hour clock can have a different number of allowed digits in each place (24 hours, 60 minutes, and 60 seconds, for example). Counting works the same way in all of these systems: When incrementing the rightmost digit causes it to roll from its maximum value back to zero, we “carry” this overflow by incrementing the next digit to the left: 09 increments to 10 in base 10, and 00:00:59 increments to 00:01:00 on the clock.</p>

<p><span>In the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system" rel>factorial number system</a><span> (not a prank), the </span><em>N</em><span>th digit from the right has base </span><em>N</em><span>, and thus a maximum allowable digit of </span><em>N</em><span>−1. As a result, the rightmost digit is always 0, the digit to its left can be 0 or 1 (in good old base 2), the next digit can be 0, 1, or 2 (in base 3), and so on. This is called the factorial number system because the place value of the </span><em>N</em><sup>th</sup><span> digit is (</span><em>N</em><span>−1)!.</span></p><p><span>Let’s look at an example. Suppose a number is written 103210 in the factorial number system. What is this number in base 10? It’s </span><strong>1</strong><span>(5!) + </span><strong>0</strong><span>(4!) + </span><strong>3</strong><span>(3!) + </span><strong>2</strong><span>(2!) + </span><strong>1</strong><span>(1!) + </span><strong>0</strong><span>(0!), or 143. (Note that the numbers in bold are exactly the digits from the factorial number representation.)</span></p>

<p>What is the smallest number in the factorial number system that is divisible by the whole numbers from 1 through 5, while also containing all of the digits 0 through 5? (Note that this number can have more than one copy of any given digit.)</p><p>You can submit this number using the factorial number system or in base 10.</p>
