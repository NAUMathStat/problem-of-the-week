<p> Four pegs begin on the plane at the corners of a square. At any time, you may cause one peg to jump over a second, placing the first on the opposite side of the second, but at the same distance as before. The jumped peg remains in place. Can you maneuver the pegs to the corners of a larger square? </p>
