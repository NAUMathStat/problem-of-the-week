<p>A cryptarithm is an arithmetic puzzle in which the digits and operations have been removed. In this cryptarithm, each digit is a prime (2, 3, 5, or 7). </p>


<div style="text-align:center; font-size:18px">&nbsp;  *  *  * <br> <u>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *  *  </u> &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;*  *  *  *  &nbsp;<br> <u> *  *  *  * &nbsp;  &nbsp;</u> &nbsp;<br>  * * * * * &nbsp; &nbsp; </div>



<p>There is only one solution. Give the correct arrangement of digits and the two operations. Bonus for a clear explanation of the process you used to determine the solution.  </p>
