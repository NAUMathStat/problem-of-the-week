<p>Your great aunt just took you for lunch at Josephine's and you are going to walk to the post office in downtown Flagstaff to mail a letter. Josephines is at the corner of Elm and Humphreys. The Post Office is 4 blocks south and 4 blocks east at the corner of Aspen and WC RIles.</p>

<p>How many different routes are there if you only allow allow yourself to walk south or east along any block? (Avoiding alleys and shortcuts) </p>
