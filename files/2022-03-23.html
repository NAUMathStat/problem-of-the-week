<p>
An unusual gaming die is made by starting with a solid sphere and cutting off six 
congruent caps,
such that each resulting circular face is tangent to the four adjacent faces.  
The figure gives an indication
of the shape of the die, drawn with transparent faces.

What is the ratio of the area of the six faces, divided by the total surface area of the die?

<b>Rules for Problem of the Week</b>
<p>
The contest is open to all undergraduates at Northern Arizona University.
<p>
Send your submissions or questions to Jim Swift at
<a href="mailto:jwswift@gmail.com?subject=potw" target="_blank">jwswift@gmail.com</a> 
by the due date and time.
Please include the subject &ldquo;potw&rdquo; so I can find it in my often overflowing inbox.
You may be able to answer the question with a plain email, but for most problems you will want to 
include a scan of your solution.  If you don't have access to a scanner use a phone app like
CamScanner or Adobe Scan.
<p>The answers should be clearly and logically explained.  The goal is to write mathematics, not to
 to write down the answer and draw a box around it.
<p>
	If your instructor gives you credit for submissions to problem of the week, please include their name
	and the class  (e.g. Swift, MAT 239) the first time you submit a solution.  
(After that I have the information in my spreadsheet.)
</p><p>
	Problems will be graded on a scale of 1 to 3.  A model solution is posted each week.
	A ladder listing the points earned is posted in the lobby of the Adel Math Building 
	(across from the MAP room).  Your name will be printed on the ladder, but no names will be published on the web.
	Let me know if you want to remain anonymous on the posted ladder.
