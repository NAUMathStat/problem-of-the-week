<p> Given some unit circles on the plane, we colored each center blue. On the circumferences of the circles, we marked some points red such that there should be exactly 2 red points on the circumference of each circle. What is the maximum possible number of blue points if there are 25 colored points altogether?  </p>

<p> Reminder: I am looking for a well-reasoned solution that walks me through the mathematical reasoning, not just an answer with a box around it. </p>
