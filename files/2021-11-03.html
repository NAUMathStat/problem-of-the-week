A solo game is played with tiles.  A tray can hold 7 tiles, but only six tiles are used.
The initial configuration has 3 tiles on the left, a space in the middle, and three tiles on the right.
The tiles on the left have arrows pointing to the right, 
and the tiles on the right have arrows pointing to the left.
The goal is switch the position of the tiles, moving one tile at a time.
The allowed moves are that a tile can slide into an adjacent empty space, 
or jump over exactly one tile into an empty space,
in the direction of its arrow.
<p>
Here is the initial position.

Here is the final position (the goal).

Hint: For this problem a clear and logical explanation of the solution is not really needed.
Give the sequence of moves, using some notation you develop, or draw a picture of the tiles after each move.
If possible, describe how you came up with the sequence of moves.

<b>Rules for Problem of the Week</b>
<p>
The contest is open to all undergraduates at Northern Arizona University.
<p>
Send your submissions or questions to Jim Swift at
<a href="mailto:jwswift@gmail.com?subject=potw" target="_blank">jwswift@gmail.com</a> by the due date and time.
Please include the subject &ldquo;potw&rdquo; so I can find it in my often overflowing inbox.
You may be able to answer the question with a plain email, but for most problems you will want to 
include a scan of your solution.  If you don't have access to a scanner use a phone app like
CamScanner or Adobe Scan.
<p>The answers should be clearly and logically explained.  The goal is to write mathematics, not to
 to write down the answer and draw a box around it.
<p>
	If your instructor gives you credit for submissions to problem of the week, please include their name
	and the class  (e.g. Swift, MAT 239) the first time you submit a solution.  
(After that I have the information in my spreadsheet.)
</p><p>
	Problems will be graded on a scale of 1 to 3.  A model solution is posted each week.
	A ladder listing the points earned is posted in the lobby of the Adel Math Building 
	(across from the MAP room).  Your name will be printed on the ladder, but no names will be published on the web.
	Let me know if you want to remain anonymous on the posted ladder.
</p>
