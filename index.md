title: Problem of the Week

<p>Description here...Should include contact information for Bahattin.</p>

I'm envisioning a growing list of links below to problems (in reverse chronological order) with titles like "Problem of the Week: October 8, 2018" (or similar).  Then in the sidebar, we can have link to "Current Problem of the Week", which always takes you to a PDF of the current problem.  Thoughts?

- [Problem of the Week: October 8, 2018]({{ site.baseurl }}/Problem2018-10-08.pdf) (currently a dead link)
- Older stuff included?  How far back?
