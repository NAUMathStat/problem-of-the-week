<b>Rules for Problem of the Week</b>

<p>
The use of online resources is only permitted to clarify basic definitions needed for the problem. Otherwise, no use of calculators and/or online resources (including Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) is premitted. The contest is open to all undergraduates at Northern Arizona University. The top two problem solvers of the semester will receive a \$100 and a \$50 prize respectively. Solutions are due at 11:59pm every Monday. 
</p>

<p>Due Monday, Sep 22nd, 2025 at 11:59 pm submitted to 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/884166"> this Gradescope Course</a> as a pdf of either typed or neatly handwritten and scanned work. If you don't have access to a scanner use a phone app like CamScanner or Adobe Scan or scan at the library. <b> You might need to create an account with your NAU email. To enroll into the Problem of the Week course use entry code: NYZ56P. </b>  

<p>**The answers should be clearly and logically explained. ** The goal is to write a convincing mathematical argument that supports your solution, not to write down the answer and draw a box around it.

	Problems will be graded on a scale of 0 to 4.  A model solution is posted each week.
	A ladder listing the points earned is posted in the lobby of the Adel Math Building 
	(across from the MAP room).  Your name will be printed on the ladder, but no names will be published on the web.
	Let me know if you want to remain anonymous on the posted ladder and what name you would prefer to use.
